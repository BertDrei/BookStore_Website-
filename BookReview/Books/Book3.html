              &nbsp;&nbsp; This is the story of a wealthy Indian Brahmin, Siddhartha who casts-off a life of privilege to seek spiritual fulfillment. We are invited along on Siddhartha’s journey experiencing his highs, lows, loves and disappointments.

He sets out on his journey, not realizing that he is fulfilling the prophecies proclaimed at his birth. Siddhartha blends in with the world, showing the reader the beauty and intricacies of the mind, nature and his experiences on the path to enlightenment. His eventual attainment of Nirvana does not come from someone imparting the wisdom to him but instead through an internal connection to the river, which he finds contains the entire universe.

              &nbsp;&nbsp; Siddhartha is written in lyrical prose. I often felt that I was transported to India, travelling with Siddhartha through the countryside. Originally written in German and translated into numerous languages including English, reading Siddhartha was like reading a book in Hindi. I say so because I find translating Hindi phrases into English makes them a bit more formal and respectful, and the writing in Siddhartha was very much that.Ego plays an important role in Siddhartha. He is on a journey to vanquish it, however, as he progresses, he comes to realize how it led him to do certain things. The events in the story speak to how it leads him to experience pleasure, while at the same time causing self-destruction.

              Most people… are like a falling leaf that drifts and turns in the air, flutters, and falls to the ground. But a few others are like stars which travel one defined path: no wind reaches them, they have within themselves their guide and path.”

              “Whether it is good or evil, whether life in itself is pain or pleasure, whether it is uncertain-that it may perhaps be this is not important-but the unity of the world, the coherence of all events, the embracing of the big and the small from the same stream, from the same law of cause, of becoming and dying.”
