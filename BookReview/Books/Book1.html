              &nbsp;&nbsp; Aurelius used to own the world. Back when the Roman
              Empire dominated a staggering percentage of available land mass,
              Aurelius was at the head. He fought wars, studied philosophy,
              watched over his kingdom, and watched even more carefully over
              himself. And lucky for you— he wrote his musings on life in a
              journal. Learning about stoicism (the philosophy central to this
              book) I realized that without knowing it, I’ve actually been
              living a pretty stoic life. In fact, I can see a lot of my
              reactions to life obstacles as having a stoic nature to them.
              This, I believe, is what’s helped me push through a lot of these
              circumstances and come out on top both in business and life in
              general. This is also why I feel this book — and stoicism in
              general — could be massively beneficial to you in your own
              struggle
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; There’s a lot more in the book than the three themes
              above. What I love, is how naturally his thoughts apply to
              business and active living (living life as opposed to letting life
              live you). While I appreciate you coming here and learning from
              me, I wholly recommend you take a few hours to learn from
              Aurelius. Again, this man used to own the “civilized” world. His
              humility, self-accountability, and reasoned approach to difficulty
              is inspiring. Pick up the book, learn a little about stoicism, and
              let me know what you think in the comments below. If you’ve
              already read through the book, tell me how it influenced your own
              life. P.S. There are a lot of translations of the book, but I
              would recommend this version. A lot of the other ones are written
              in hard to understand old english.
