              &nbsp;&nbsp; In the introduction, Holiday stresses that this book is meant to be accessible to those new to Stoicism, but he also cautions readers to read the original works to get a fuller understanding of Stoicism's tenets. So after a year of my Stoic journey, what did I think? Am I a diehard Stoic? No. far from it, but I can say definitively that parts of this book were helpful in many areas of my life. The book contains a short reading for every single day of the year - beginning with a quote by a famous Stoic, then the quote is distilled into a brief blurb with modern examples. Moving a bit farther out, every month has a theme, so for example, July is Duty, August is Pragmatism, and all the Stoic quotes surrounding that topic are grouped together there. On an even higher level, the book is split into three distinct sections: The Discipline of Perception (January–April), The Discipline of Action (May–August), and finally, The Discipline of Will (September–December). The back of the book contains a nice glossary with key terms, followed by a note on translations and a brief further reading section.

              &nbsp;&nbsp;I read a passage every day for that assigned day and then journaled about it following the prompts provided. Real talk: I did not do this every day. You were supposed to journal once in the morning, and then ruminate, and write another entry in the evening. After 8 months of sporadic journaling, I ditched the journal aspect and found it more enjoyable and the information more retainable. Why? Because the accompanying journal prompts at times didn't match the quote/thought of the day at all.
