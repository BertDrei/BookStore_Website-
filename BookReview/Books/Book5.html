              &nbsp;&nbsp; Atomic Habits by James Clear was an absolute game-changer of a book for me. It’s a book I recommend people read so often I thought it was time to create a summary.

I enjoyed the book so much that I’ve actually listened to it on Audible twice and read the book!

I love Audible and I’ll always have it on in the background when I’m doing mundane chores or driving or walking my dog. It’s a great way to learn something new whilst also doing those boring, everyday tasks you’ve got to do!

A friend then bought the book for my birthday and I found myself absorbing it in a whole new way.

I even went through the book and highlighted interesting quotes and sections – something I haven’t done since I was in university many moons ago! I just feel like there are so many incredible nuggets of advice that could have such a huge impact on your life.

              &nbsp;&nbsp; Atomic Habits is a personal development book by James Clear. It’s about simple rules that will help you develop good habits and stop bad habits. The book has sold over 5 million copies worldwide and is described as ‘life changing’ by many people. Including me!

I read lots of personal development books and Atomic Habits is the best I’ve ever read.

The book is easy and enjoyable to read. There’s no technical jargon in there and it’s broken up into small sections, making it easy to digest and it feels like a quick read.

Lots of the tips are the type that are so simple and obvious that they’re often overlooked.

Some were things I’d never considered and many were things I already did but it wasn’t until it was highlighted to me that I realised the power of them. I realised I had lots of unconscious habits and becoming conscious of them enabled me to harness the power of them and apply them to other things

              “All big things come from small beginnings. The seed of every habit is a single, tiny decision. But as that decision is repeated, a habit sprouts and grows stronger. Roots entrench themselves and branches grow. The task of breaking a bad habit is like uprooting a powerful oak within us. And the task of building a good habit is like cultivating a delicate flower one day at a time.”
