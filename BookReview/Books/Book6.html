            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; The books in the Hitchhiker’s Series that I am reviewing are The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, Life, the Universe and Everything, So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish, and Mostly Harmless. The graphic I grabbed has The Salmon of Doubt, but I haven’t read that one either.

I learned in Neil Gaiman’s Don’t Panic, that The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy first started as a radio show by Douglas Adams that ended up becoming very popular. Publishers approached Douglas Adams to write the book and so the radio show is somewhat similar to the first three books, at least most of the scenes are similar.

If you like a nice organized plot, these books are not for you.  If you like well-rounded character with consistent motives, these books are not for you. If you like a series that doesn’t have plot holes, well… you get the point.

So what do these books have going for them?

            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; They are hilarious in an odd sort of nihilistic sort of way. Take Monty Python and then add a semi-truck load of existential angst. It has been years since I read these books, and I suspect I will be reading them again soon. They are not the shining light of perfect writing, but the written form of humor in these novels are genius. Very few people write humor well. As I grow as a writer, my admiration for those who find success also grows. Writing is hard work. Writing humor multiplies that difficulty.

            <p>Douglas Noel Adams (11 March 1952 – 11 May 2001) was an English author, screenwriter, essayist, humorist, satirist and dramatist. Adams was author of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which originated in 1978 as a BBC radio comedy, before developing into a "trilogy" of five books that sold more than 15 million copies in his lifetime and generated a television series, several stage plays, comics, a video game, and a 2005 feature film. Adams's contribution to UK radio is commemorated in The Radio Academy's Hall of Fame.[2] </p>
